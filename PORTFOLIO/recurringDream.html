	<h1>My Recurring Dream about Rabbid Freddy Fazbear!!!!<h1>
	<p>So basically, I have weird dreams. My most recent weird dream, which has now occured more than once (most likely due to unhealthy amounts of hours into the FNAF franchise), is that of Freddy Fazbear himself chasing me down, covered in blood and foaming at the mouth. It's quite terrifying, yes, but at this point, the nightmare has replayed too many times in my head for me to be scared anymore once I wake up. Nothing ever happens, he just chases me, sometimes killing me but most of the time not. It's quite bizarre, and I wish everyone who reads this could experience the same dream as it truly is an experience.<p>
