		The Internet has opened up many opportunities for connection, creativity, and sharing over the past years, allowing anyone to find other people with the same interests or hobbies with ease. However, despite the positive connotations of this, the Internet has also enabled new forms of hating, cyberbullying, and predatorial behavior accessible by anyone. So, this has raised the question of whether anonymity on the Internet should be implemented everywhere or if it shouldn't be a concept at all; which is safer? In this article, we will go over the pros and the cons of Internet anonymity, as well as how you can implement it in whatever ways you like.

			<a>There are strong arguments in favor of allowing anonymity online. Anonymity can protect people from harassment, discrimination, and even violence in the physical world. It allows individuals to speak out against oppression and abuse without fear of reprisal. Anonymity can also promote free speech and creativity, as people feel less constrained when they don’t have to worry about being identified. Furthermore, it enables people to connect with others who share interests and experiences without risking damage to their offline reputations.

			For many marginalized groups, anonymity online provides a crucial outlet. People who are isolated in their daily lives can find community and support in anonymous online spaces. Anonymity also protects whistleblowers who expose unethical practices. Overall, anonymity facilitates a more open and equal exchange of ideas online. </a>

			<a>However, anonymity also comes with risks. It can enable bullying, hate speech, fraud and other predatory behaviors without accountability. Law enforcement has a much harder time identifying and prosecuting cyber criminals who hide behind anonymity.

			Anonymity can also undermine trust and relationship building online. It is more difficult to assess someone’s true intentions and character when you don’t know who they really are.

			Some governments have already imposed restrictions on anonymity to address these dangers. China’s social credit system offers a concerning example of how state surveillance could be extended into online spaces to suppress dissent.</a>
